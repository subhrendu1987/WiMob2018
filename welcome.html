<h1 >Welcome</h1>
<p>It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 14th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob'2018) in Limassol, Cyprus. Since the 1st WiMob in 2005, the IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications has been the key forum for the exchange of knowledge and experience among researchers, developers and practitioners of wireless and mobile technology. For thirteen years, the International IEEE WiMob conference has provided unique opportunities for researchers and developers to interact, share new results, show live demonstrations, and discuss emerging directions in Wireless Communications, Mobile Networking and Ubiquitous Computing.
Putting together WiMob 2018 has been a team effort. First of all, we would like to thank the authors of all submitted papers. Furthermore, we would like to express our gratitude to the program committee and to all external reviewers, who worked very hard on reviewing papers and providing suggestions for their improvements.
